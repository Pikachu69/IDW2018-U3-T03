        <h2>Bienvenido</h2>

        <p>Bootstrap was created at Twitter in mid-2010 by @mdo 
            and @fat. Prior to being an open-sourced framework, 
            Bootstrap was known as Twitter Blueprint. A few 
            months into development, Twitter held its first 
            Hack Week and the project exploded as developers of 
            all skill levels jumped in without any external 
            guidance. It served as the style guide for internal 
            tools development at the company for over a year 
            before its public release, and continues to do so 
            today.

            Originally released on Friday, August 19, 2011, 
            we've since had over twenty releases, including 
            two major rewrites with v2 and v3. With Bootstrap 
            2, we added responsive functionality to the entire 
            framework as an optional stylesheet. Building on 
            that with Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the library once 
            more to make it responsive by default with a mobile 
            first approach.
